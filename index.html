    <h1>Introducing to you a new game of names</h1>
    <h3>What's in a name?</h3>

    <p>

Say you have twins, identical in every way. Will their difference in names cause them to look different over time?

Yes, argues Marketing Professor Jacob Goldenberg and his colleagues. Perhaps more surprisingly, the twins' facial appearances will also conform to a cultural stereotype around that name: Jacobs, for example, all tend to look like a Jacob, while Rachels all have something very Rachelish about them.

Goldenberg and his research colleagues are now collecting the data to prove it, following up on a headline-making study published a year ago called, “We Look Like Our Names,” co-authored with Yonat Zwebner of the University of Pennsylvania, Nir Rosenfeld of Harvard, Anne-Laure Sellier of HEC Paris, and Ruth Mayo of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

<h3>My new naming system</h3>
<p>My new naming system is called Akan naming system. Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.

  Most people do know when their birthdays are, but some might not know what day of the week they were born. Luckily for us, there are ways to calculate the day of the week from a specific date and through our calculator, we have been able to come up wit a formula to derive a new Akan name based on the gender and date of birth</p>

  <p>Let's play the game of names now;<br>
